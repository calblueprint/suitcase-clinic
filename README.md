About Blueprint

We strive to make beautiful engineering accessible and useful for those who create communities and promote public welfare. Our vision is a world where the good, passionate, and visionary have the biggest impact on our communities and society.

Our Project
=======
Our client, The Suitcase Clinic, (http://www.suitcaseclinic.org/), whose mission is to offer free health and social services to underserved populations, approached us to build a search engine and review system for their resources. We hope that our project with them will aid them in achieving their goals.
